### HOW WE FINALIZED PAPER PROTOTYPE AND APPLY IT ON WIREFRAME
We first finalize our idea, after that we we start searching application related to that solution and read about the application features and the real time implementation of this app in underpriviliged school like how they will be able to use this application. We choose applications like zoom, team, google meet. After deciding the platform, we implement their low fedility prototype on paper and then work on medium fedility. 
Our second approach was to implement the prototypes on digital wireframe or any freeware tool. So, we choose platform Proto.io. This platform helps us to deliver our interface more clearly to user. There are three different prototype for teacher, student and for admin as per their authorities. On digital platform, we describe step by step procedure to use the application which may help them to understand the flow of application.

### HOW OUR DESIGN FULFILL THE GUIDELINES, RULES AND HEURISTICS
Our design fulfill the discoveribility principle, it is simple to use and every feature is visible to user. This application is flexile for all users. Teachers have rights to allow students or remove those students from the meeting who make disturbance in class. The environment of the application is user friendly. Taleem Ghar application adopt all the necessary features that should be their for low level folks, which help them to use these kind of application quickly.
